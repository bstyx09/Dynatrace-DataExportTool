This is a tool for exporting timeseries data from the Dynatrace API

It uses a simple GUI for users to build their api calls and then execute them.
The data is output to a table and in a json format

This tool helps to make the Dynatrace API more accessible for users without a lot of background in development

Data from the table can easily copied and pasted into Excel for further manipulation. This solves a pretty significant hurdle a lot of users may have with using data returned from the API.

Currently has been tested with Dynatrace version 1.186 but should still work with most other versions that allow for USQL api calls
